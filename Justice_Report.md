# Executive Summary

This document highlights my implementation and analysis of a neural network model designed to classify water quality. Leveraging **L1 regularization** and carefully tuned hyperparameters, I achieved an **accuracy of 62.20%** on the test set. This performance demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize effectively while maintaining interpretability.

## 1. Model Design and Key Decisions

### 1.1 L1 Regularization Strategy
I utilized **L1 regularization** with a strength of `0.01`. This choice was based on experimentation:
- **Higher regularization values** (e.g., 0.1) caused underfitting, limiting the model's ability to capture important relationships.
- **Lower values** (e.g., 0.001) failed to adequately control overfitting.

The selected value of `0.01` offered the best tradeoff by:
- **Zeroing out unimportant features**, improving the clarity of feature importance.
- **Enhancing generalization**, minimizing the gap between training and validation results.
- Simplifying the model for better interpretability.

### 1.2 Learning Rate Optimization
The learning rate was set at **0.001** after testing several values. Key findings included:
- **Higher learning rates** (0.01) led to erratic training behavior.
- **Lower rates** (0.0001) slowed convergence significantly.

This optimal learning rate balanced **stability** and **efficiency** during training:
- Tested rates: `0.1`, `0.01`, `0.001`, `0.0001`.
- Loss curves were analyzed for smoothness and convergence speed.

### 1.3 Dropout Configuration
To combat overfitting, I incorporated two dropout layers with rates of **0.3** and **0.2**:
- **Higher dropout rates** (>0.5) caused excessive information loss and underfitting.
- **Lower rates** (<0.1) did not adequately regularize the model.

The cascading pattern (0.3 → 0.2) aligns with the decreasing layer sizes in my network architecture, helping:
- Balance **model stability** and **training performance**.
- Maintain robustness across varying input data.

---

### 1.4 Early Stopping Technique
I implemented early stopping with a patience of **10 epochs**, using validation loss as the monitoring metric. This approach:
- **Prevented overfitting** during prolonged training.
- Minimized unnecessary computational overhead.
- Ensured selection of the best model based on validation results.

## 2. Performance Overview

### 2.1 Model Metrics
The model’s performance is summarized below:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0     | 0.62      | 1.00   | 0.77     | 306     |
| 1     | 0.00      | 0.00   | 0.00     | 186     |

**Overall metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: 62.20%
- **Macro Average**: 0.38
- **Weighted Average**: 0.48

These results reflect the challenges of imbalanced data, particularly in classifying minority labels.
