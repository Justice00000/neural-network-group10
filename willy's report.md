# Executive Summary

This document presents my implementation and analysis of a neural network model for water quality classification.

## 1. Model Design and Key Decisions

### 1.1 L2 Regularization Strategy
I implemented **L2 regularization** with a strength of `0.01` to mitigate overfitting while preserving model complexity. Key observations:
- **Higher values** (e.g., `0.1`) excessively penalized large weights, leading to underfitting.
- **Lower values** (e.g., `0.001`) did not provide sufficient constraint, allowing overfitting.

The chosen value of `0.01` ensured:
- **Improved generalization**, reducing the performance gap between training and validation sets.
- **Weight decay**, preventing excessively large weight magnitudes.
- **Stable optimization**, avoiding drastic weight updates.

---

### 1.2 Learning Rate Optimization
The learning rate was set at **0.01**, selected based on multiple experiments. Key findings:
- **Higher rates** (`0.1`) caused training instability and oscillations in loss.
- **Lower rates** (`0.001`) resulted in slow convergence.

My final choice of `0.01` ensured:
- **Fast yet stable convergence**, balancing speed and reliability.
- **Efficient weight updates**, leading to improved learning dynamics.

### 1.3 Dropout Configuration
To counteract overfitting, I employed dropout layers with rates of **0.2** and **0.3**:
- **Lower dropout values** (`<0.1`) were insufficient to prevent overfitting.
- **Higher values** (`>0.5`) led to excessive neuron deactivation, reducing learning capacity.

The chosen dropout configuration offered:
- **Enhanced generalization**, preventing reliance on specific neurons.
- **Stronger feature representation**, maintaining relevant signals.

---

### 1.4 Early Stopping Technique
I utilized early stopping with a patience of **10 epochs**, monitoring validation loss. This strategy:
- **Avoided unnecessary training**, stopping when no further improvements were observed.
- **Minimized overfitting**, preserving optimal model performance.
- **Reduced computational costs**, ensuring training efficiency.

## 4. Conclusions and Future Directions

My approach to water quality classification integrates **L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping** for enhanced generalization. Although the model performed well, future work should explore:

2. **Hybrid regularization (L1 + L2)** to optimize feature selection and stability.
3. **Addressing class imbalance** with oversampling or weighted loss functions.

This project demonstrates the importance of careful hyperparameter selection in neural network optimization.
